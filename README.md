## Introduction
The project is for people who love data science and have grown up playing football and are FIFA enthusiasts. The data is scraped from the website https://sofifa.com by extracting the Player personal data, followed by Player IDs and their playing and style statistics.
Insights and correlations between player value, wage, age, special attributes, and performance can be derived from the dataset. This uninterpreted data can be converted into information by analyzing it. I have derived summary statistics for teams, clubs, & players. Through extensive football experience: the insights provided in the results, along with understanding, and contextualized information enables users to act smartly when playing FIFA, picking a better team for say Fantasy Premier league, or increase their betting odds.

## The Data
## Data Description
The data was scrapped from the sofifa website using a python crawling script. The website contains the data from the EA Sports' game FIFA and gets updated regularly with the release of new versions of the game. data developed by Electronic Arts for the latest edition of their FIFA game franchise. Through several research projects done on soccer analytics, it has been established in the field of academia that the use of data from the FIFA franchise has several merits that traditional datasets based on historical data do not offer. Since 1995 the FIFA Soccer games provide an extensive and coherent scout of players worldwide.
For each attribute, we have an integer from 0 to 100 that measures how good a player is at that attribute. Examples of attributes are: dribbling, aggression, vision, marking and ball control. Observe that it seems to be unfeasible to accurately characterize players in these attributes automatically. Thus, all of those are gathered and curated by the company whose job is to bring the gameplay closer to reality as possible, hence preserving coherence and representativeness across the dataset.
The FIFA 18 dataset that has been used for this analysis provides statistics of about 16000 players on over 70 different attributes. These attributes are optimal indicators to determine the performance of a player at a particular playing position.
